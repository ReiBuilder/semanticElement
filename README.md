# SemanticElement

Although the name of this project is SemanticElement, it will never provider the tool to find or record semantic element.
It's only a support tool to get word's definition by using Merriam-Webster official web service.
I use python to achieve the goal because to I want to take some practices, so you will find that the code style,
especially the name style is similar to Java -- I use Java most.

## If some one want to use the tool, some thing need to note:
1.  keep the project structure. or you need to modify some path string.
2.  the files in wordList folder are examples that show you how to organize target words into a txt file and use the tool to get the definition of these words from web service.
3.  read the config.ini.example file, write your own configs on right place, and delete the suffix ".example".
4.  oh, I use the 3.5.2 version of Python. (If I use the right words.)
